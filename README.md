### Meta Seo Checker
This extension is mainly aimed at web developers that need to verify the HTML of their site to follow the Webmasters' Google Guidelines, but even to who is curious about any page contents that are usually not visible, but can reveal interesting site properties.

### Dimensions
This extension measures the dimensions from your mouse pointer up/down and left/right until it hits a border. So if you want to measure distances between elements on a website this is perfect. It doesn't really work with images because there the colors change a lot pixel to pixel.

### DataLayer Checker (google analytics testing)
The easiest way to debug and check the dataLayer implementations without having to use the browser console!
